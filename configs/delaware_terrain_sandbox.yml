# Pipeline configuration: Delaware River Basin terrain — SANDBOX subset.
#
# Small bbox (~200 catchments in upper Delaware near Hancock, NY)
# for fast iteration (~1-2 minutes vs ~10 min for full basin).
#
# Run with:
#   python -m hydro_param configs/delaware_terrain_sandbox.yml
#
# Environment: pixi run -e full python -m hydro_param configs/delaware_terrain_sandbox.yml
